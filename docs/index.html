    <p>Hello World! Welcome to my online portfolio.</p>
    <p>
      Technology and innovation have always been a passion of mine and I am focused on expanding my expertise in the tech field.
      I have experience working as a Full Stack Developer, Data Analyst, and Quality Assurance Developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love working on complex problems and implementing effective solutions.
      I also enjoy designing intuitive user interfaces on the frontend side.
      My favorite feeling after a product launch or feature implementation
      is the excitement of watching users try out and explore the work I have created.

      I'm currently in my 4th year as an Undergraduate at the University of Waterloo studying
      <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/future-undergraduate-students/mechatronics-engineering" target="_blank" class="link">Mechatronics Engineering</a> 
      which involves the design of mechanical and electrical integrated systems. 
      In cooler terms, I learn about robots!
